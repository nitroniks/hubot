# Kato Hubot Adapter

## Description

The Kato Hubot adapter allows you to use [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com) in your Kato team.

## Installation

Install Hubot (consult the [Hubot documentation](https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs) for more information):

    $ sudo npm install -g yo generator-hubot

Create a new bot:

    $ mkdir myhubot
    $ cd myhubot
    $ yo hubot

You will be asked which adapter to use, type `kato`.

## Configuration

First, create a new Kato account for your bot. It’s best to create a new email address, eg. `kato-bot@mycompany.com` and invite this address to your Kato team. Verify the email and set a name for your bot in its new account (that name shows up when it posts a message).

Next, you will need to set some environment variables:

    $ export HUBOT_KATO_LOGIN="katobot@mycompany.com"
    $ export HUBOT_KATO_PASSWORD="5prz8OKty6"

## Usage

Once that’s done, you can start Hubot with Kato as the adapter:

    $ ./bin/hubot -a kato

Please ignore `npm WARN` and `deprecated` messages, they are generated by packages unrelated to the Kato adapter. You shoud be able to see your bot online in Kato just a few seconds after you ran this command.

### Notes

The Kato addapter supports listening for commands in

- all unrestricted rooms
- restricted rooms, to which it has been explicitly added
- 1 on 1 chats with the bot itself

You can address your bot by beginning a message with its name, which defaults to `Hubot`.
You can change this and also set an alias using the following additional environment vars:

    $ export HUBOT_NAME="Frank"
    $ export HUBOT_ALIAS="!"

Your bot should now reply to `!ping` with `PONG`.

The bot will not respond to itself.

### Optional Logging

Log filename (the default is `kato-hubot.log`):

    $ export HUBOT_KATO_LOG_FILE="path/filename.log"

Log level (one of `error`, `debug`, or `info`. Default is `error`):

    $ export HUBOT_KATO_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
